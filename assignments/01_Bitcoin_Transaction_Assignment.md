# Assignment 01 - Bitcoin Transaction

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate that you can construct a valid bitcoin transaction, and broadcast it successfully on the Bitcoin Test Network.

## Requirements

* A document or script within your repository, which shows your work in both constructing, and broadcasting the transaction.

* The transaction ID of the Bitcoin transaction, on the Bitcoin Testnet network. It should be publicly viewable on a Blockchain explorer, such as [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/testnet).

## Resources

## Solution
There are several transaction types that are detailed in this repository and were tested on regtest and then used on testnet. Each of these transactions was generated "by hand" using Python, and then broadcast to the Bitcoin Test Network via JSON RPC calls to bitcoin core.
