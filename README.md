# bergsy-bitcoin
Repository for EE382V Blockchain and Smart Contracts

## Assignments
Assignments are described under the `assignments` folder. The assignment will contain the description of the assignment, as well as the code (or a link to the code) that completes each assignment. There are 3 assignments:
1. Bitcoin Transaction
2. Bitcoin Script
3. Lightning Payment

## Code
Most of the code is written in Python and lives under the `code` folder. This allows libraries to be utilized multiple times across different assignments and projects.

## Project(s)
Any projects will be separate folders under the `code` folder. Currently there are 2 projects that are both a work in progress: `app` and `escrow`. The project under `app` is a Flask app with a goal of becoming a Bitcoin enabled version of AirBNB. The project under `escrow` is a project that is trying to show off the abilities of escrow through Bitcoin. Both of these are a work in progress.
